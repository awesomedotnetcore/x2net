# Installation

## NuGet

The NuGet package [x2net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/x2net) can be installed
via the [Package Manager UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui),
or by the following Package Manager console command:

```
PM> Install-Package x2net
```

The xpiler converts x2 definition files into corresponding C# source code files.
So most probably you will want to install the
[x2net.xpiler package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/x2net.xpiler) too.

```
PM> Install-Package x2net.xpiler
```
